Modulo Library for Arduino
===============================

To install, follow the instructions at [docs.modulo.co](http://docs.modulo.co/getting-started-arduino.html).

If you want to make changes to this library, first make sure it's not already
installed in the Arduino IDE, then clone the repository under your sketchbook/libraries folder.
